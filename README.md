# gaskap-fields
Filter and plot GASKAP Magellanic survey fields

This is a collection of code and output files showing the proposed fields for the Magellanic portion of the Galactic ASKAP pilot and final surveys.

The fields were generated with the command:

```bash
tile_sky.py -c MAGEL -n closepack36 -f 1419.5 -z 16 -l gaskap_mag -P AS108 -r '0.680489,-2.319511'
```

The code is as follows:
* Notebooks:

  * [extract_gaskap_pilot.ipynb](../blob/master/extract_gaskap_pilot.ipynb) - Creates a cutout subcube covering the GASKAP pilot region (the SMC and surrounds) and plots a map with the fields overlaid.
  * [filter_tiles.ipynb](../blob/master/filter_tiles.ipynb) - Produces a set of DS9 region files showing the fields for each of the pilot and full surveys.

* Bash scripts:

  * [GASKAP_footprint.sh](../blob/master/GASKAP_footprint.sh) - Script to output footprints for the field in kvis format. Generated by tile_sky
  
* SED Scripts:
  * [ann2ds9.sed](../blob/master/ann2ds9.sed) - SED script to convert a .ann file, as output by tile_sky.py, to a DS9 region file.
